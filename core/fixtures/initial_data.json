      "content": "Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel the algae (zooxanthellae) living in their tissues, causing them to turn white. This happens when corals are stressed by changes in conditions such as temperature, light, or nutrients. When water is too warm, corals will expel the algae living in their tissues causing the coral to turn completely white. While bleached corals are not dead, they are under more stress and are subject to mortality. The main cause of coral bleaching is climate change, which leads to higher sea temperatures. El Niño events also contribute to mass bleaching events worldwide.",

They support more species per unit area than any other marine environment, including about 4,000 species of fish, 800 species of hard corals, and hundreds of other species. Despite covering less than 0.1% of the ocean floor, reefs host more than 25% of all marine species. Beyond biodiversity, coral reefs provide crucial services: they protect coastlines from storms and erosion, provide food and livelihoods for millions of people, contribute to medical discoveries, and generate billions in tourism revenue. Protecting these ecosystems is essential for both marine life and human communities.",

Several techniques show promise: Coral gardening involves growing coral fragments in nurseries before transplanting them to degraded reefs. Microfragmentation speeds up coral growth by cutting corals into small pieces. Coral breeding programs help maintain genetic diversity. Artificial reef structures provide substrate for coral attachment. Scientists are also developing super corals - strains bred or engineered to be more resilient to warming waters. While restoration alone cannot solve all reef problems, it's a valuable tool when combined with reducing stressors like pollution and overfishing.",

      "content": "Ocean acidification, often called climate change's evil twin, poses a significant threat to coral reefs. As the ocean absorbs excess CO2 from the atmosphere, it becomes more acidic, making it harder for corals to build their calcium carbonate skeletons. Recent research shows that acidification affects coral growth rates, structural integrity, and their ability to recover from bleaching. Some corals show adaptive capacity, but the rate of change may outpace their ability to adapt. Studies also reveal complex interactions between temperature stress and acidification. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for predicting reef futures and developing effective conservation strategies.",
